# pandas cheat sheet

A [Jupyter notebook](Pandas%20cheat%20sheet.ipynb) with some common data manipulations you might do while working in pandas.

## Run the notebook

Clone or [download/unzip](https://github.com/cjwinchester/pandas-cheat-sheet/archive/master.zip) this repo and install the dependencies (`jupyter` and `pandas`), preferably in a virtual environment of some sort.

I'm using [`pipenv`](https://docs.pipenv.org/), so If you have pipenv installed:
- `cd path/to/where/this/repo/lives/on/your/computer`
- `pipenv install`
- `pipenv run jupyter notebook`
